# Aerial-Cactus-Identification using Pytorch

## This dataset is part of Kaggle competitions.

This dataset contains a large number of 32 x 32 thumbnail images containing aerial photos of a columnar cactus (Neobuxbaumia tetetzo). Kaggle has resized the images from the original dataset to make them uniform in size. The objective was to build a classifier to predict whether an image contains a cactus.
